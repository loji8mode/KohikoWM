// Kohiko Settings' write path back into kohiko.conf. Config (Config.h)
// is the *read* path everywhere else in this project uses, and stays
// exactly as it was - a parsed, unordered key/value store with no way
// to write anything back. ConfigWriter is the opposite: it keeps the
// file as literal lines of text and only ever touches the specific
// line(s) a given key or repeatable-directive prefix owns, so every
// comment, blank line, and everything the person hasn't touched
// through the GUI comes back out of Save() exactly as it went into
// Load() - "the configuration files remain the source of truth" is
// what this class exists to guarantee, not just a comment.
//
// Two shapes of key are handled, matching config/default.conf's own
// two shapes of key (see its own header comment):
//
//   - Scalar keys ("last one wins" if repeated) - SetScalar()/GetScalar().
//   - Repeatable directives (`bind=`, `exec.<name>=`, `windowrule=`,
//     `monitor=`) where the same prefix legitimately appears many
//     times - GetRawBlock()/ReplaceRawBlock(), which Kohiko Settings
//     uses to back a plain multi-line text editor rather than
//     pretending each is an individually-typed scalar setting (see
//     SettingsWindow.cpp's RawBlockPanel).
